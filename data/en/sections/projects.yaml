  timeline: "October 2020 - January 2021"
  #repo: https://github.com/connorputnam/connorputnam-finalproject-Election_Simulation
  #url: ""
  summary: Built a parameterized report that numerically and visually displayed data to a particular EV car charger or group of car chargers. Data was pulled from an internal database and was then used to build out a report that could be used to inform a non-technical audience and/or investors. The report was highly dynamic in that the user can request to see an analysis for one charger, all charger in a particular geographical location, chargers during specific times, and much more.
